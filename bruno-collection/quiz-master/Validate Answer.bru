  # Validate Answer
  
  This endpoint validates the user's answer to a question. It returns whether the answer is correct and provides feedback.
  
  ## Variables
  
  - `sessionId`: The session ID returned from Create Quiz Session endpoint
  - `questionId`: The ID of the current question
  - `answerId`: The ID of the selected option/answer
  
  ## Response Example
  
  ```json
  {
    "correct": true,
    "message": "Correct answer!",
    "remainingAttempts": 3,
    "remainingQuestions": 4,
    "correctAnswerId": "opt1"
  }
  ```
  
  If the answer is incorrect and there are remaining attempts, the user can try again. If there are no remaining attempts or the answer is correct, the next question will be available.
